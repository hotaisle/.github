At Hot Aisle, we believe competition drives innovation. One company currently dominates the hardware and software for building AI applications, we believe itâ€™s high time for alternatives. We're democratizing high-performance compute (HPC), making cutting-edge resources accessible to all developers. No single player should control the future of transformative technology - our mission is to provide a diverse and open environment for AI and HPC.

We achieve this by enabling open access to HPC with our top-tier bare metal solutions. As a NeoCloud, we offer hyperscaler uptime with unmatched white glove service, performance, security, reliability, and scalability. All backed by our unique partnerships with large corporations, such as Dell Technologies, AMD, Broadcom, Switch, Advizex and more.

Through us, you gain access to the latest AMD MI300x enterprise accelerators and a team of professionals to guide you every step of the way. Our best-in-class supercomputer is tailored for AI, data analytics, and high-performance computing, designed to tackle the most demanding tasks.
